# ai-memory hook helper — find marker file + parse minimal TOML.
# Sourced by per-agent lifecycle hook scripts. POSIX shell only —
# no bash-isms, no external deps (no jq, no toml crate). Keep changes
# byte-trivial because every supported agent (claude-code, codex,
# cursor, gemini-cli, opencode, omp) sources this same file.

# Walk up from "$1" toward $HOME (or /) looking for `.ai-memory.toml`.
# Prints the absolute path of the first marker found, or nothing.
# Stops at $HOME to avoid leaking declarations from a shared system
# user's home into another user's session on multi-user boxes.
